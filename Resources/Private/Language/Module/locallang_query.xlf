          The Query Controller is dedicated to identifying "expensive" operations that degrade site performance.
          It specifically filters for queries utilizing Full Table Scans (FTS), which indicate
          that the database is reading every row in a table due to missing or suboptimal indexes.
          Additionally, the controller provides a curated list of the slowest queries recorded within
          the application scope. Unlike the global server slow-query log, this module focuses on
          application-level performance, making it an essential tool for developers during
          the refactoring and indexing phases.
